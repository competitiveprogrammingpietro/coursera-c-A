The repository contains the completed homeworks for the Coursera training
course "C++ for C programmers". There have been three homeworks :

1 - Design a class representing a class
2 - Use the class to implement the Dijkstra's SPT algorithm
3 - Add a further method to compute the Prim's MST algorithm
