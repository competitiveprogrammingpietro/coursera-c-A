The repository contains the completed homeworks for the Coursera training
course "C++ for C programmers". There have been three homeworks :

1 - Very basic C++ example covering input and inline
2 - Design a class representing a graph and use it to implement the Dijkstra's
    SPT algorithm
3 - Add a further method to compute the Prim's MST algorithm
